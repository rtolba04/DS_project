Alien Invasion Simulation is a C++ data structures project that models a turn-based battle between Earth and Alien armies.
The workflow of the simulation is as follows:
- The program starts in main.cpp, which initializes the game and creates a Game object.
- The Game class controls the entire simulation lifecycle.
- At each time step, Game generates and organizes army units using appropriate data structures.
- Battles are executed between Earth and Alien units, with health and states updated accordingly.
- The simulation continues until a termination or victory condition is reached.
